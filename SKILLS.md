## Power-Up Trigger Points
- 1st power-up: 10 coins collected
- 2nd power-up: 20 coins collected (30 total)
- 3rd power-up: 40 coins collected (70 total)
- 4th power-up: 80 coins collected (150 total)
- 5th power-up: 160 coins collected (310 total)
- Pattern continues: each threshold doubles

## Progression System
- Linear progression per tree
- Each direction (Up/Down/Left/Right) maintains its own skill index
- Player can only get the next skill in each tree
- Example: If Up tree is at skill 3, pressing Up offers skill 4
- Trees progress independently
